### Witcher 3 Enemy Scaling and Other Balance Changes

##### Version: 1.0

#### Oils

- Changed charges from (20, 40, 60) to (100, 200, 300)

- Changed % attack power increase from (10%, 25%, 50%) to (10%, 20%, 35%)
  
  * I felt the 50% increase for the level three oils was too high even in Death March difficulty. By the time
    you get them in the late game and the reverse difficulty curve it makes Geralt even more OP (in my opinion).
    I originally planned to make it 30% but left it at 35% because they're harder to create.

#### Monster Enemy Changes

- Increased enemy group vitality and damage from 10% to 25%

  * Makes group management more important

- Changed low-level enemies (those with Grey nameplates) attack power from -40% to 40% and added 50% increase 
  in health.

- Changed high level (red nameplate) enemies health increase from 350% to 50% and attack power increase
  from 500% to 50%. 

   * It appears the game simply adds large health and damage increases to enemies above Geralt's level to make them 
     absorb damage like sponges and kill you in one or two hits. By decreasing the bonuses to enemies near Geralt's
     level, they should still be difficult to fight but not unbalanced.

- Changed deadly enemies (red skull nameplate) health increase to 25% from 800% and attack power from 500% to 110%.

   * Attack power increase may still be too high, but I wanted to make the deadly enemies manageable but still
     slightly OP. This may be adjusted as I test further.

#### Human Enemy Changes

- Increased low-level human enemies vitality and attack power 100% and 20%.

- Removed high-level humans (red nameplates) bonus health and attack power.

- Decreased red nameplate human resistances from 50% to 25%.

- Removed deadly enemies (red skull nameplate) bonus health and attack power.

- Reduced red skull enemies' resistances from 100% to 30%

#### Geralt

- Level 51 for some reason doesn't add a skill point so I changed it back to 1. If this causes any unintentional issues
  then I'll revert back.

- Removed per level increase in spell power.

- All skill slots are now unlocked by level 20. Originally, skill slots were unlocked at levels 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 22
  26, 30. Slots are now opened at levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.

- Mutagen slots are now unlocked by level 20, unlocking at levels 2, 8, 14, 20. Slots were originally unlocked at levels 2, 9, 16, 28.

#### Overall Difficulty

- Increased enemy bonuses in Death March difficulty. Enemies now have 100% more health from 80% and deal 250% more damage,
  from 200%.

- Increased enemy bonuses in Blood and Broken Bones difficulty. Enemies have 50% more health from 20% and deal 150% more damage,
  from 130%.
