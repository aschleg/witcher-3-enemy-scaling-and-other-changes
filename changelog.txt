Balance and Enemy Scaling Changes

Description

I love the Witcher series so much I wanted to share my mod that I recently created to smooth out the difficulty curve and make it challenging throughout.
With the release of the ModKit, I was inspired to see if I could try my hand and providing a challenging experience into the end game. I love the challenge
presented in the Witcher series and the more difficult it is the more like a Witcher I feel, haha.

On my Death March playthrough, I loved the challenge presented in the first 15 levels or so, however; after that the game becomes much easier
and gets even easier when you get the top-level gear and items. This was also the case in the Witcher 2, even on Dark Mode, you could steamroll
through the game starting in Act 2. 

I wanted to see if I could keep the difficulty presented in the early game throughout without making any drastic changes to gear and such. This was 
accomplished by removing penalties and bonuses to enemies below and above Geralt's level. I also adjusted some items' power down as I felt even in
Death March they were overpowered. 

I haven't gotten into the late game on my new playthrough so I can't report on that yet; if anyone has any feedback to share it's definitely appreciated!

Installation

Go to your Witcher 3 installation folder, such as C:/GOG Games/The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt or Steam/steamapps/common/The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and copy the mod
folder into your mods directory. Create the mods folder if you don't have one.

The final file structure should be Witcher 3 Folder/mods/modScalingandBalance.

That's it!

Uninstallation

Delete the modScalingandBalance folder from your mods directory.


Version: 1.0

Items

Oils

- Changed % attack power increase from (10%, 25%, 50%) to (10%, 20%, 35%)
  
  * I felt the 50% increase for the level three oils was too high even in Death March difficulty. By the time
    you get them in the late game and the reverse difficulty curve it makes Geralt even more OP (in my opinion).
    I originally planned to make it 30% but left it at 35% because they're harder to create.

Monster Enemy Changes

- Increased enemy group vitality and damage from 10% to 25%

  * Makes group management more important

- Changed low-level enemies (those with Grey nameplates) attack power from -40% to 40% and added 50% increase 
  in health.

- Changed high level (red nameplate) enemies health increase from 350% to 50% and attack power increase
  from 500% to 50%. 

   * It appears the game simply adds large health and damage increases to enemies above Geralt's level to make them 
     absorb damage like sponges and kill you in one or two hits. By decreasing the bonuses to enemies near Geralt's
     level, they should still be difficult to fight but not unbalanced.

- Changed deadly enemies (red skull nameplate) health increase to 25% from 800% and attack power from 500% to 110%.

   * Attack power increase may still be too high, but I wanted to make the deadly enemies manageable but still
     slightly OP. This may be adjusted as I test further.

Human Enemy Changes

- Increased low-level human enemies vitality and attack power 100% and 20%.

- Removed high-level humans (red nameplates) bonus health and attack power.

- Decreased red nameplate human resistances from 50% to 25%.

- Removed deadly enemies (red skull nameplate) bonus health and attack power.

- Reduced red skull enemies' resistances from 100% to 30%

Geralt

- Level 51 for some reason doesn't add a skill point so I changed it back to 1. If this causes any unintentional issues
  then I'll revert back.

- Removed per level increase in spell power.

- All skill slots are now unlocked by level 20. Originally, skill slots were unlocked at levels 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 22
  26, 30. Slots are now opened at levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.

- Mutagen slots are now unlocked by level 20, unlocking at levels 2, 8, 14, 20. Slots were originally unlocked at levels 2, 9, 16, 28.
